## 💻 About the Project

♻️ **Ecoleta** - A platform to connect companies and waste collection entities with people who need to dispose of organic and inorganic waste in an eco-friendly way.

Companies or entities can register on the web platform by providing:
- An image of the collection point
- The entity's name, email, and WhatsApp number
- The address to display on the map
- One or more waste collection items:
  - Lamps
  - Batteries
  - Paper and cardboard
  - Electronic waste
  - Organic waste
  - Cooking oil

Users will have access to the mobile app, where they can:
- Navigate the map to see registered institutions
- Contact the entity via email or WhatsApp

This project was developed during the **NLW - Next Level Week**, an event by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br).
NLW is an online experience with practical content, challenges, and hacks available for one week.
